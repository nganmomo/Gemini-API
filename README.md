# GEMINI-API

**GEMINI-API** This GOOGLE GEMINI API example is what I took from Github and Youtube, and most of the examples have been tested.
I used my application to send a message to GEMINI, and the result returned was not in a file format. My intention was to link AI support with my application, but it was unsuccessful.

**Set env** GET API KEY From GOOGLE GEMINI, add ".env" file in your folder. and set API_KEY="your API KEY" 

**RUN APP** e.g. "node gemini-pro-circuit"
