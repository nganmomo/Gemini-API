# GEMINI-API

**GEMINI-API** This GOOGLE GEMINI API example is what I took from Github and Youtube, and most of the examples have been tested.
I used my application to send a message to GEMINI, and the result returned was not in a file format. My intention was to link AI support with my application, but it was unsuccessful.
